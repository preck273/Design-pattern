### Introduction
This is an university group project. For the end assignment of Design Pattern, the students need to make a project. Their idea should 
include at least four design patterns.

### Idea
The group has decided to create a pancake diner simulator. The idea is that the user manages a diner
by having to take orders, make them, have the pancakes bring by a waiter to the customer and 
complete the order by receiving your pay. 

For making the pancakes, the Abstract Factory design pattern is going to be used. The reason is that 
the pancake could be sweet or salty and they can have different types of toppings or creams.

For making the orders, the Command design pattern is going to be used. The reason behind is that the
customer is able add, update or remove from their order anytime while the order is being executed.

For the process of the payment, the Strategy design pattern is going to be used. The reason is that the 
customer is able to pay with card or with cash.

For having the workers, the Template Method design pattern is going to be used. As Waiter and Chief 
have different jobs to do; the waiter handle the payment and the chief handle the pancakes.

### Conclusion
The game idea is chosen since in a diner there is a lot of things going on at once. The students thought 
they might practice the programming language and the subject in a fun and entertaining way. The 
team hopes this is going to be sufficient for finishing the subject and getting a good grade.
